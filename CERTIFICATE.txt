Area of Training – Brief Outline of Work Done

Involvement in the development, testing, and enhancement of the in-house web application FLIGHTBYTES for retrieval and archival of post-flight data. Contribution to mission data integration, database maintenance, and modification of mission datasets within the system. Participation in flight telemetry and orbital data processing activities for launch missions including PSLV-C60 and LVM3-M6, along with support in parameter file preparation for missions such as SSLV-L1 and TV-D2 CM. Implementation support for data visualization and frequency plotting features integrated into the FLIGHTBYTES web application. Development of graphical plotting interfaces for comparative analysis and visualization of flight parameters. Involvement in UI modernization and frontend enhancement of the web application, improving usability, visual consistency, and overall user experience through structured design updates. Involvement in the design and implementation activities of a user-specific “Saved List” feature intended to enable quick access to frequently used parameter datasets. Exposure to telemetry data extraction processes and participation in post-launch data upload, validation, and system update activities. Participation in testing, verification, and troubleshooting of software modules to ensure accuracy and reliability of flight data outputs. Work carried out using Java-based web technologies, relational database systems, and Python-based scientific data visualization tools within a controlled intranet environment. Overall exposure gained in professional software development, structured data processing workflows, and secure handling of mission-related data in a high-reliability, process-driven Research and Development (R&D) environment.
